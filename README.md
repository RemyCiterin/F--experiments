# fstar-experiments
several experiments on F * for the generation of (almost) automatic proofs

## todo : 
1. AVL tree (done)
2. Set and Map module (done)
3. Binary Decision Diagram (typed in this case for more efficient memoization)
4. eventualy a SAT solver
5. a little SMT solver (linear algebra and non-interpreted functions and variables) but... it's realy hard
